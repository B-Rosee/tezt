  <h2>Historical Places To Visit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p id="Castle"><strong>Neuschwanstein</strong></p>

      <p id="Castle2">Today Neuschwanstein is one of the most popular of all the palaces and castles in Europe. Every year 1.4 million people visit "the castle of the fairy-tale king". In the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended
        for a single inhabitant. The Neuschwanstein Castle was built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. <br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Schloss_Neuschwanstein_2013.jpg/1280px-Schloss_Neuschwanstein_2013.jpg" alt="Neushwanstein"

      </p>
      <br></li>

    <li>
      <p id="Gate"><strong>Brandenburg Gate</strong></p>
      <p id="Gatee"> Brandenburg Gate is Berlin’s most popular landmark. A symbol of Berlin and German division during the Cold War, it is now a national symbol of peace and unity. It drew visitors who used to climb an observation platform in order to get a glimpse
        of the world behind the Iron Curtain, on the other side of the barren "death-strip" which separated East from West Berlin.<br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Brandenburger_Tor_DRI_filtered.jpg" alt="Brandenburg Gate"
          width="305" id="GATE">

      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="Church"><strong>The Cologne Cathedral</strong>
        <p id="Churchs">The Cologne Cathedral has a long and interesting history that spans through many centuries. Excavations undertaken after World War II yielded some new information about the history of Cologne Cathedral. The earliest traces of the Christian church
          can be dated to back the 4th century.<br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%B6lner_Dom_nachts_2013.jpg" alt="The Cologne Cathedral" width="254" id="C">

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="Forest"><strong>The Black Forest</strong>
        <p id="Forest2">The Black Forest is a mountainous region in southwest Germany, bordering France. Known for its dense, evergreen forests and picturesque villages, it is often associated with the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. It's renowned for its spas and the cuckoo
          clocks produced in the region since the 1700s. The region’s largest town, Freiburg, is filled with Gothic buildings and surrounded by vineyards.<br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Schonach_-_Paradies_-_Sonnenaufgang.jpg/1280px-Schonach_-_Paradies_-_Sonnenaufgang.jpg"

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="Rhine"><strong>The Rhine River</strong>
        <p id="Rhine3">The Rhine is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the German Rhineland
          and the Netherlands and eventually empties into the North Sea.<br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/D%C3%BClmen%2C_Hausd%C3%BClmen%2C_Kettbach_--_2015_--_8499-503.jpg" alt="Rhine River" width="313px" id="R">

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p id="EagleNest"><strong>The Eagle's Nest</strong>
        <p id="EagleNest2">Hitler's Eagles Nest, Germany, still sits on a mountain peak high above Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps. In one of history's weird turns, Martin Bormann's birthday present to Adolf Hitler is now a cosy restaurant with a spectacular of the Alps.
          This historic survivor of the Third Reich can only be reached by taking a special bus (or a strenuous 3 hour walk) to an elevator shaft set deep in the mountain. Once at the top, you can explore most of the rooms and have something to eat or
          drink in the same spot that Hitler, Eva Braun, Himmler and the rest had their banquets and entertained foreign diplomats. Outside, just past the beer garden terrace, a path leads up to a higher point well worth the short climb.<br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Kehlsteinhaus_280605_008.jpg"

  <h3>Best Time To go to Germany</h3>
  <p id="Travel">Germany's weather can be relatively cold in the winter, but summer is definitely the time when the weather is the finest. From May to September, expect warm days with the possibility of an occasional rain storm. Also, expect to delight in many colorful
    flowers in the quaint home gardens in the villages, as well as the vast gardens of the "Schloss," or castle you're almost certain to find in every larger city. With the fine weather, however, comes the high tourist season, so expect prices to go up
    and the availability of accommodations to go down.</P>
  <p id="Travel2">If you're not a fan of battling crowds of any size, your best bet is visiting Germany during the "shoulder seasons" from March through May and from late October through November. The weather may be a bit chilly, but you'll enjoy lower prices and fewer
    crowds. Some of the highlights of the shoulder seasons include Maifest in May, a May Day-like festival with colorful costumes, and Rhein in Flammen, or Rhein in Flames, featuring fireworks displays over many villages of the Rhein River.<br> <img src="https://www.studyabroad.com/sites/default/files/images/Germany-Spring-Semester-Study-Abroad-Programs.jpg"
